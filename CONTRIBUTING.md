# Want to contribute?

## Well, that's nice! Welcome aboard.

You can contribute in *many ways*:

- Rendering a new example (please, keep it under 10Mb, if possible).
- Optimizing the code to run faster or with less memory.
- Implementing other famous fractals.
- Optmizing filesizes would also be interesting.

Create your own fork and make any changes you find interesting and I'll surely give it a look!

However, follow these guidelines:

- Only add new examples if you find them interesting enough, and only 1 (one) per fork.
- Make sure the code you optimized still works before making a pull request.
- If you implement other famous fractals, make sure to also change the README.md file to also explain it's formulas.
- If you make a program to optimize filesize, make sure that it works from images in any resolution range.

**Thanks a lot!**
